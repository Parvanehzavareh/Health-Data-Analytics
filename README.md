# Health Data Analytics Project: Obesity Level Prediction
# Project Description
This project, developed for DSP5100 Health Data Analytics, aims to predict obesity levels using a dataset of health measurements. Various machine learning models were evaluated to find the most effective in predicting different obesity levels from given attributes such as age, height, weight, and eating habits.
# Data
The dataset ObesityDataSet_raw_and_data_synthetic.csv is used, which includes various health measurements and personal habits. This data is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets for model development.
